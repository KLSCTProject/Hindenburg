		<p>While the government, and a few aircraft corporations have been experimenting more with rigid airships in the past few years, the majority of airships today are not Dirigibles, instead opting for blimps, that use one large, cigar shaped balloon, filled with Helium gas to stay afloat. In order to maintain a proper buoyancy so that the blimp doesn’t go too high or too low, the captain can control smaller balloons within the larger one that fill full of air. This adds more surface area for the Helium gas particles to bounce off of, increasing the pressure, which applies directly to Boyle’s Law, which proves that pressure and volume are inversely related to one another. To be fair, most blimps and airships today are completely safe because they use Helium gas instead of Hydrogen gas, but are still a taboo of American transportation because of the Hindenburg crash. </p>
