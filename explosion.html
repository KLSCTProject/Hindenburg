		<p>While it is largely unknown to this day what exactly caused the explosion to occur, scientists and historians alike agree on the fact that hydrogen gas had leaked out of one of the gas cells and mixed with the air to form a literally explosive combination. While Hydrogen gas is already flammable, the presence of Oxygen makes it even more of a dangerous substance to utilize. However, in order for the explosion to occur, there must first be a spark, or a fire of some kind, which is where the mystery lies. Where did this spark or fire come from? Was it intentional? Or was it a result of the turbulent, slightly thunderous weather in the air at Lakehurst at the time? To this day we do not know. Nevertheless, the minute the spark made contact with the gas, the entire ship would catch fire and explode, burning the cover and sending it down, missing the landing moor that it was supposed to connect to. The cabins and passenger areas were thankfully a bit more protected than the majority of the ship that was used to house the gas cells, so many of the passengers actually ended up being okay, while 35 of them were unfortunately deceased. </p>
