		<p>Today, not only is the use of Hydrogen gas in blimps and airships banned because of this great tragedy, but passenger airships are banned altogether, being used strictly for business and research purposes. If the Hindenburg had gone completely as planned and used Helium gas instead of Hydrogen, than technically speaking, the Zeppelin would have been completely safe, and it would have flown fine. And while technology such as the composite materials used to make the fabric, and the type of the airships have changed to fly more aerodynamically, the same science and ideas that were known and used back then such as the Gas Laws, are still largely in use today with airships, just not as much. </p>
